# Super-Resolution-using-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-GAN-and-Autoencoders
• Sending high-resolution images directly to consumers (for streaming services and high-fidelity monitors) leads to a lot of utilization of bandwidth <br>
• Deployed two different deep learning techniques, autoencoders and SRGAN, using three different datasets <br>
• Main idea was to examine the dependence of the inverse reconstruction function (used to transform a low-resolution image to a high-resolution image) on the dataset that each model is trained on <br><br>
